field is unique in whole

inference: focus on immutability now.  programmer write explicit initialization qualifiers on methods which wants behaviour different than default, i.e. free rather than commmited.
nninf directory - simple nullness type system inference(doesn't implement all the type rules)

example to which level in class hierarchy during initialization for immutability guaranteee. good or bad to track until which class fields are initialized?

write small unit tests, have dummy visitos - fail - add assignment visit logic - let assignment tests pass - add method invocation visit rules - let those tests pass - and continue until all the tests pass.

Focus on implementation of viewpoint adaptor and target locations and wrapping up GUT(and inference). -> extends to left hand side
