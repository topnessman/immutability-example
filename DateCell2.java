        // But here, we are instantiating poly return type to mutable type from a readonly receiver. Doing so doesn't harm anything of course,
        // but it makes the type system not intuitive anymore. Intuitively, a poly something becomes anything that is used to access it, that
        // should be the receiver. If a programmer really wants to mutable the returned object, he/she should make the return type of getWhatever mutable.

        // adaptation to receiver makes more sense than lhs.
